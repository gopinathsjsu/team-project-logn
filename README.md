## Schedule for Scrum Meetings:

Sunday - 8PM to 8:30 PM(end of the week to understand next steps and work remaining)
<br />

## XP Core Values:
Below are the XP core values we have used throughout the project.   <br />
Communication  <br /> 
Simplicity  <br />
Feedback  <br />
Courage  <br />
Respect  <br />

Our focus was mainly on **communication** and **Feedback**. We have made our journals based on these two values and have seen significant improvement in the overall process down the line.
### Communication:
Communication was achieved by constantly staying in connection with each other via sprint plans for planned meetings and whatsapp group for unplanned meeting requests.
This method has helped us to ease the process of working in a team and work with a common goal.

### Feedback:
We have dedicated 10 minute weekly feedback sessions to evaluate our performance so far and came up with a plan to improve the weekly performance ahead.
Feedback helped us in identifying the blockers and perform better.
 
### <u>Observation:</u>
Through communication we kept each member of the team in loop and jumped into a call wherever there were blockers in order to have clear roadmaps ahead.
Through Feedback we made sure that the end result was reaching the completion of application and learning the technological implementations along with agile methodologies.
By the end of Sprint 4 we observed that the blocker on each team member were almost none and hence experienced the advantages of XP core values.
